# C-Hangman-Game
This C++ program is a text-based Hangman game where players guess a hidden word letter by letter. It includes input validation, ASCII art, and tracks wins, losses, and total games played.

Hangman Game Instructions:

1. Guess the hidden word one letter at a time.

2. Each wrong guess adds a part to the hangman.

3. You lose after 6 incorrect guesses.

4. Only enter single alphabet letters (case doesn't matter).

5. No repeat guessesâ€”each letter can only be tried once.

6. After each round, you'll have the option to play again.

Good luck and have fun!
